Good Fun - Creating a array based parser/ast/visitor generator

When you think of parser/ast/vistor generators you normally think of classes,
polymorphism and pointers.
Though, this is, no doubt, the reasonable way of approach such a project more
fun can be had.
Maybe we can even improve on things by not following the standard way, but
having fun outside of the box.
In this talk we explore we therefore explore what happens if we do the
interesting/fun things instead of reasonable, boring, standard things.
